#🎨 Creative Theme Toggles

Go beyond boring switches — bring your brand to life with delightful, personality-rich theme toggles users will love.

#✨ Overview

Creative Theme Toggles is a collection of handcrafted, animated theme toggles built with
Next.js 15, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion.

Each toggle tells a small visual story — blending motion, light, and emotion — to transform the simple act of theme-switching into a memorable experience.

| Toggle                             | Description                                                                              | Highlight Feature                        |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| 🏮 **Lantern Toggle**              | A glowing lantern that sways softly, lights up the night, and plays calm ambient sounds. | Animated reflection and stars            |
| 🪩 **Mood Orb Toggle**             | A liquid-like orb that pulses with mood-based color gradients.                           | Framer Motion color transitions          |
| 🌸 **Cherry blossom Toggle** | Cherry blossom petals fall gracefully in dark mode, soft petals in light mode.           | Petal physics + dual seasonal animation
